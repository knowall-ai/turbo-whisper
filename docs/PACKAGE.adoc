= Turbo Whisper Packaging Guide

:toc-placement!:

This document describes how to package and distribute Turbo Whisper via Linux package managers.

toc::[]

== Overview

Turbo Whisper is distributed through Linux package managers:

* **AUR** - Arch User Repository (`yay -S turbo-whisper`)
* **PPA** - Ubuntu Personal Package Archive (`sudo apt install turbo-whisper`)

== Current Status

| Channel | Status | URL

| AUR
| Live (v1.0.0)
| https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/turbo-whisper

| PPA
| Live (v1.0.0)
| https://launchpad.net/~bengweeks/+archive/ubuntu/turbo-whisper

== Why Not PyPI?

PyPI (Python Package Index) is not used for this project because:

1. **PyPI is designed for libraries and developer tools**, not desktop GUI applications
2. **System dependencies cannot be installed via pip** - Turbo Whisper requires `portaudio`, `xdotool`, and `xclip` which must be installed separately
3. **Poor user experience** - Users would need to manually install system deps before `pip install` works
4. **Discovery** - Users searching for "voice dictation linux" look in distro repos, not PyPI

For desktop applications like Turbo Whisper, native package managers (AUR, PPA) provide a better experience by handling all dependencies automatically.

=== Future Considerations

**Flatpak** (via Flathub) may be added in the future as it:

* Works across all Linux distributions
* Bundles dependencies (no system dep issues)
* Provides sandboxing and automatic updates
* Is where users look for desktop applications

== AUR (Arch User Repository)

=== What is AUR?

The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a community-driven repository for Arch Linux users. It contains package descriptions (PKGBUILDs) that allow users to compile packages from source.

=== Package Details

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Package Name | `turbo-whisper`
| AUR URL | https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/turbo-whisper
| Maintainer | Ben Weeks <ben.weeks@outlook.com>
| License | MIT
|===

=== PKGBUILD Location

The PKGBUILD file is maintained in: `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD`

=== Installation for Users

[source,bash]
----
# Using yay (recommended)
yay -S turbo-whisper

# Using paru
paru -S turbo-whisper

# Manual installation
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/turbo-whisper.git
cd turbo-whisper
makepkg -si
----

=== Updating the AUR Package

1. Update version in `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD`
2. Update checksums: `updpkgsums`
3. Generate .SRCINFO: `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO`
4. Clone AUR repo: `git clone ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/turbo-whisper.git`
5. Copy PKGBUILD and .SRCINFO to AUR repo
6. Commit and push

[source,bash]
----
# Full update workflow
cd packaging/aur
updpkgsums
makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO

# Clone AUR repo (first time)
git clone ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/turbo-whisper.git ~/aur-turbo-whisper

# Or pull latest
cd ~/aur-turbo-whisper && git pull

# Copy files
cp PKGBUILD .SRCINFO ~/aur-turbo-whisper/

# Commit and push
cd ~/aur-turbo-whisper
git add PKGBUILD .SRCINFO
git commit -m "Update to version X.Y.Z"
git push

== PPA (Personal Package Archive)

=== What is PPA?

A Personal Package Archive (PPA) allows Ubuntu users to install packages via `apt`. Packages are built on Launchpad's build servers and signed with GPG.

=== Package Details

| PPA Name | `ppa:bengweeks/turbo-whisper`
| Launchpad URL | https://launchpad.net/~bengweeks/+archive/ubuntu/turbo-whisper

=== Debian Packaging Location

Debian packaging files are in: `packaging/debian/`

=== Installation for Users

[source,bash]
----
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bengweeks/turbo-whisper
sudo apt update
sudo apt install turbo-whisper
----

=== Building the Debian Package

==== Prerequisites

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install devscripts debhelper dh-python python3-all python3-setuptools
----

==== Build Process

[source,bash]
----
# Create source tarball
python -m build --sdist

# Extract and prepare
cd dist
tar xzf turbo-whisper-*.tar.gz
cd turbo-whisper-*

# Copy debian directory
cp -r ../../packaging/debian .

# Update changelog (for new version)
dch -i "New upstream release"

# Build source package
debuild -S -sa

# Upload to PPA
dput ppa:bengweeks/turbo-whisper ../turbo-whisper_*_source.changes
----

=== GPG Key Setup

You need a GPG key registered with Launchpad:

[source,bash]
----
# Generate key (if not exists)
gpg --full-generate-key

# Export and upload to keyserver
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys YOUR_KEY_ID

# Add key to Launchpad account via web interface
----

== Supported Ubuntu Versions

The PPA currently builds for:

* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy)

To add support for additional Ubuntu versions, create separate changelog entries for each distribution and upload separately.

== Version Management

When releasing a new version:

1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Update `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD` (pkgver)
3. Update `packaging/debian/changelog`
4. Create git tag: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"`
5. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
6. Update AUR package
7. Upload to PPA
